# Week 1 â€” App Containerization
Week one has been interesting, i ran behind in my submission. Ran into some problems trying to run the cruddur app. It took me time but finally had it working. Learnt how to use docker, docker compose and the importance of having the ports open and running.
I also rewatched all the videos listed on the checklist for the week .
I completed the two quizzes and submitted them.
I got an opportunity to experiment using cloud9, Snyk, and Clair

Also managed to installed Docker on Ec2 as see below
